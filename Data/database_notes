NOTES on Network Evaluation Tools data sets


Gene sets:
- DisGeNET Gene Sets (DisGeNET_genesets.txt)
- Oncogenic Component Gene Sets (Oncogenic_Components_genesets.txt)
Two tab separated files, each line containing a gene set from either DisGeNET or the Oncogenic Component collection. The first column of each file is the name of the gene set followed by the list of genes associated with that given gene set on the same line.


Network performance scores (based on AUPRCs) on the gene sets:
- DisGeNET performance (DisGeNET_genesets_AUPRCs.csv)
- Oncogenic Component performance (Oncogenic_genesets_AUPRCs.csv)
Two csv files containing the raw "Z-normalized" AUPRC (=Area Under Precision-Recall Curve) scores (i.e. network performance scores) of each network analyzed on each gene set analyzed from DisGeNET or the Oncogenic Component gene set collection.


Network performance effect size metric - performance gain
- DisGeNET effect size metric (DisGeNET_genesets_Effect_Size.csv)
- Oncogenic Component effect size metric (Oncogenic_genesets_Effect_Size.csv)
Two csv files containing the relative performance gain of each network's AUPRC score over the median null AUPRC score for each gene set analyzed from DisGeNET or the Oncogenic Component gene set collection.
"To determine the network rankings by an effect size metric, we defined the performance gain as the difference between the AUPRC of a given network and the median AUPRC of its null networks divided by the median AUPRC of its null networks"



My notes on the scores
Performance/Z score: In the statistical litterature this is usually the "signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point differs from the mean value..." (Wikipedia: Standard Score), while the authors here define their Performance/Z score as "the robust z-score of the true AUPRC of the gene set recovery task as compared to the background of AUPRCs from the degree matched null networks." If the Wikipedia definition is to be followed we have z-score = (AUPRC - mean(AUPRC_null)) / stdev(AUPRC_null).
My understanding is that the performance score is a measure of how much better the network is than random chance at recovering a particular gene set

Performance gain: The authors define this as "the difference between the [mean] AUPRC of a given network and the median AUPRC of its null networks divided by the median AUPRC of its null networks." i.e. performance gain = (AUPRC - median(AUPRC_null)) / median(AUPRC_null)

Size adjusted performance:
In order to calculate the size-adjusted performance, a linear model was fit to the performance scores of each task against the log10-adjusted network interaction count. The residual values for each performance score were calculated against their respective size-adjusted performance models
